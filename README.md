**Fast & Efficient English to Sinhala Subtitle Translation using Multiple Google Gemini API Keys.**

This application provides a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter to translate English SRT subtitle files into Sinhala. It leverages multiple Google Generative AI (Gemini) API keys for faster processing and resilience against rate limits.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Multi-API Key Support:** Rotate through multiple API keys to maximize translation speed and avoid rate limits.
*   **Batch Processing:** Translates subtitles in batches for improved efficiency.
*   **Retry Mechanism:** Automatically retries failed batches.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple GUI for selecting input/output files and monitoring progress.
*   **Real-time Logging:** View translation progress and any issues in the log window.
*   **Customizable Batch Size:** Adjust the number of subtitles processed per API call.
*   **Auto API Key Rotation:** Option to enable or disable automatic switching between API keys.
*   **Progress Bar & Speed Indicator:** Track the translation progress and current speed.
*   **UTF-8 Support:** Ensures correct handling of Sinhala characters.
*   **Glittering Title Effect:** A visually appealing animated title.
*   **Sinhala Font Detection:** Attempts to use available Sinhala fonts for better display.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   `google-generativeai` library

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chamika1/sinhalasubgen.git
    cd sinhalasubgen
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure API Keys:**
    Open `app.py` and replace the placeholder API keys in the `self.api_keys` list with your own Google Gemini API keys:
    ```python
    self.api_keys = [
        "YOUR_API_KEY_1",
        "YOUR_API_KEY_2",
        "YOUR_API_KEY_3",
        # Add more keys if needed
    ]
    ```

## üìñ Usage

1.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
2.  **Select Input File:** Click "Browse" next to "English Subtitle File (.srt)" and choose your English SRT file.
3.  **Output File (Optional):** The output file name will be auto-generated. You can change it by clicking "Browse" next to "Output Sinhala Subtitle File".
4.  **Adjust Settings (Optional):**
    *   **Batch Size:** Set the number of subtitle lines to process in each batch.
    *   **Auto API Key Rotation:** Check/uncheck to enable/disable automatic API key switching.
5.  **Start Translation:** Click "üöÄ Start Fast Translation".
6.  **Monitor Progress:** Observe the progress bar, status messages, and log area.
7.  **Stop Translation (Optional):** Click "‚èπÔ∏è Stop" if you need to interrupt the process.
8.  Once completed, the translated Sinhala SRT file will be saved to the specified location.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1.  **Parse SRT:** The input SRT file is parsed to extract individual subtitle entries (index, timestamp, text).
2.  **Create Batches:** Subtitles are grouped into batches based on the configured batch size.
3.  **Translate Batches:**
    *   Each batch is sent to the Google Gemini API for translation.
    *   The application rotates through the provided API keys to distribute the load and avoid rate limits.
    *   If an API call fails (e.g., due to rate limiting), it retries with the next key or after a delay.
4.  **Parse Response:** The API's response (translated text) is parsed.
5.  **Save Output:** The translated subtitles are compiled into a new SRT file, ensuring correct UTF-8 encoding for Sinhala characters.
